# Introduction

`designkit` is an example UI design kit of webcomponents for a company or personal brand. The package is a wrapper for existing Shiny inputs that have been highly customized. This makes it easy for a team (or future you!) to use a library of components for any html outputs (such as a blog, report, or website) rather than start from scratch.

# Install
